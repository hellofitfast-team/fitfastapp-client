## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Royal Blue as primary color (user preference for rebrand)
- Polish over new features (get existing app solid before expanding)
- Both languages equally (MENA market requires Arabic/RTL quality)
- Demo-ready as done criteria (next step is selling to coaches)
- Skip test suite for now (focus on visible UX, not infrastructure)
- [Phase 01-01]: Royal Blue as primary via semantic Tailwind classes (all UI components updated)
- [Phase 01-02]: Charts use primary for workout data and success-500 for meal data to maintain visual distinction
- [Phase 01-02]: Error contexts use error-500, success contexts use success-500, brand accents use primary
