## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Mobile UI Renovation
Status: Research phase — defining requirements
Phase: Pre-phase (milestone setup + research)
Started: 2026-02-17

## Accumulated Context

### Pending Todos (carried from v1.0)

- AI-generated meal/workout plans are in English even when user locale is Arabic
- Push notifications hardcoded in English
- Ticket system is single-response — needs thread-style conversation
- AI model names and parameters hardcoded — should move to env vars
- localhost:3000 fallback in OpenRouter headers

### v1.1 Notes

- UI-only milestone — no backend/API/business logic changes
- Phases will start at 11 (continuing from v1.0's 10 phases)
- Must verify RTL/Arabic on all renovated pages
- Must verify mobile (390px) and desktop (1440px) viewports
