## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Both languages equally (MENA market requires Arabic/RTL quality)
- Demo-ready as done criteria (next step is selling to coaches)
- Skip test suite for now (focus on visible UX, not infrastructure)
