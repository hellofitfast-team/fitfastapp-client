<objective>
Audit and fix all interactive elements below 48x48px minimum touch target size across dashboard pages and layout components.

Purpose: PWA mobile users need 48x48px minimum touch targets (Material Design guideline). Current h-10 (40px) and h-8 (32px) elements cause touch errors and frustration on mobile devices. This covers UX-04 requirement.

Output: All interactive elements across dashboard and layout components meet 48px minimum touch target.

Read each file fully before modifying.

**Check-in page** (`check-in/page.tsx`):
- **Number rating buttons** (energy, sleep, dietary adherence - the 1-10 scale buttons): Currently `h-10` (40px). Change to `h-12` (48px).
  - Find: `className={...flex-1 h-10 border-4 border-black font-black text-xs...}`
  - Change `h-10` to `h-12`
  - There are 3 sets of these (energyLevel, sleepQuality, dietaryAdherence) - fix all of them
- **Step progress indicator squares**: Currently `h-8 w-8`. These are step number circles inside the progress bar. Change to `h-10 w-10` (the parent container provides the touch area, so the step itself can be slightly smaller, but still visible).
  - Note: The step container (`flex-1 p-3 border-e-4...`) is already large enough for touch, so the inner number square can stay at `h-8 w-8` IF the clickable area is the parent. Check if the parent has an onClick - if not, this is fine as-is since they're indicators, not buttons.
- **Photo remove buttons**: Currently `h-8 w-8` (the X button on photos). Change to `h-10 w-10` with `min-h-[48px] min-w-[48px]` to ensure touch target even though visual size is smaller. Actually, just change to `h-12 w-12` for simplicity.
- **Section header icon containers**: The `h-10 w-10` containers (e.g., Weight icon, Dumbbell icon). These are NOT interactive (no onClick), so no change needed.

**Progress page** (`progress/page.tsx`):
- **Date range buttons** (30/90/all): Currently `h-10 px-4`. Change to `h-12 px-4`.
  - Find: `h-10 px-4 border-4 border-black -ms-1`
  - Change `h-10` to `h-12`
- **Tab buttons** (charts/photos/history): Currently `h-14` - already above 48px, no change needed.
- **Photo close button in modal**: Currently `h-8 w-8`. Change to `h-12 w-12`.
  - Find the X button in the photo modal overlay

IMPORTANT: Only change sizes on truly interactive elements (buttons, links, clickable areas). Leave non-interactive containers (icon holders, decorative elements) at their current sizes.
  </action>
  <verify>`pnpm tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20`. Grep to verify no remaining h-10 on interactive buttons: `grep -n "h-10.*border-black.*transition\|onClick.*h-8\|h-8.*onClick" src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/check-in/page.tsx src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/progress/page.tsx`</verify>
  <done>Check-in number rating buttons are h-12 (48px). Progress date range buttons are h-12 (48px). Photo close button is h-12 w-12 (48px). Non-interactive containers unchanged.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Fix touch targets in FAQ, tracking, header, and sidebar</name>
  <files>src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/faq/page.tsx, src/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/tracking/page.tsx, src/components/layouts/header.tsx, src/components/layouts/sidebar.tsx</files>
  <action>
Read each file fully before modifying.

**FAQ page** (`faq/page.tsx`):
- **Number badge and chevron in FAQ items**: The `h-10 w-10` elements. These are inside a `<button>` that spans the full width, so the touch target of the button is already fine. The inner icons are visual indicators. No change needed for the inner elements since the parent button provides the touch target.
- **Search input area**: The search box is `h-14` which is fine.
- No touch target changes needed for FAQ page (the accordion buttons are full-width and already > 48px).

**Tracking page** (`tracking/page.tsx`):
- **Meal/workout toggle buttons** (the Circle/CheckCircle2 completion toggles): Find these interactive elements and check their sizes. If they're under 48px, increase to `h-12 w-12`.
- **Section expand/collapse buttons** (ChevronDown/ChevronUp for meals/workouts sections): Check their sizes. If under 48px as clickable targets, increase to meet minimum.
- **Date navigation buttons**: If there are date prev/next buttons, ensure they're >= 48px.

**Header** (`header.tsx`):
- Read the file and find all interactive elements (buttons, links)
- Any `h-8 w-8` or `h-10 w-10` interactive elements should be bumped to `h-12 w-12`
- Common patterns: locale switcher button, menu toggle button, notification bell button
- If an element is h-10 w-10 and it's a button/link, change to h-12 w-12

**Sidebar** (`sidebar.tsx`):
- Read the file and find all navigation links/buttons
- Navigation items should have minimum `h-12` or `min-h-[48px]` to meet touch targets
- Any icon buttons (close sidebar, etc.) should be h-12 w-12 minimum

IMPORTANT: Only modify interactive elements. Non-interactive decorations, badges, and indicators stay at their current sizes. When changing sizes, ensure the layout still looks good (no overflow, alignment maintained).
  </action>
  <verify>`pnpm tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20`. Then `pnpm build 2>&1 | tail -10` to verify no build errors from the changes.</verify>
  <done>All interactive elements in tracking page, header, and sidebar meet 48px minimum touch target. FAQ page confirmed already meeting targets through full-width buttons. Layout integrity preserved.</done>
</task>

<verification>
- `pnpm tsc --noEmit` passes
- `pnpm build` succeeds (catches any JSX layout issues)
- No interactive element (button, link, clickable div) below h-12 (48px) in modified files
- Non-interactive containers (icon holders, badges) preserved at original sizes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Every tappable element across the dashboard meets the 48x48px minimum touch target. Check-in rating buttons, progress filters, header buttons, sidebar navigation, and tracking toggles all sized for mobile PWA usage. No layout breakage from size increases.
