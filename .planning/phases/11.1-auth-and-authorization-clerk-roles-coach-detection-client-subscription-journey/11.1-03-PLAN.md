<objective>
Build the full marketing landing page with Hero, Features, Pricing, and Trust signals sections. Pricing reads dynamically from Convex. Full bilingual support with language switcher.

Purpose: This is the prospect's first touchpoint with FitFast. It must communicate value, show pricing, and funnel to the checkout flow (checkout itself is in plan 05).
Output: Complete marketing landing page with all sections, responsive layout, and dynamic pricing from Convex.

**Hero section (`hero.tsx`):**
- "use client" component using `useTranslations("landing")`
- Large headline: "Transform Your Body with AI-Powered Coaching" (or Arabic equivalent)
- Subheadline: brief value prop about personalized plans
- Primary CTA button: "Get Started" — scrolls to pricing section (`#pricing`)
- Royal blue gradient background, white text, mobile-first layout
- Use `Button` from `@fitfast/ui/button`
- At top: include a sticky header bar with "FitFast" logo text and the language switcher

**Language switcher (`language-switcher.tsx`):**
- "use client" component
- Two-button toggle: EN | AR
- Uses `useRouter` from `next/navigation` and `useLocale` from `next-intl`
- On click, navigates to same path with different locale prefix
- Highlight active locale with primary color

**Features section (`features.tsx`):**
- Three feature cards in a responsive grid (1 col mobile, 3 cols desktop)
- Features: (1) AI-Personalized Plans (meal + workout), (2) Smart Check-ins (progress tracking), (3) Coach Support (tickets + guidance)
- Each card: Lucide icon, heading, short description
- Use `Card` from `@fitfast/ui/card` if available, otherwise simple styled divs
- All text via `useTranslations("landing")`

**Testimonials/trust section (`testimonials.tsx`):**
- Simple trust signals section (not real testimonials — placeholder)
- 3 metric cards: "500+ Clients", "AI-Powered Plans", "Bilingual Support"
- Clean grid layout with icons from lucide-react
- Text via `useTranslations("landing")`

**Update messages files (en.json, ar.json):**
- Add all landing page strings under `"landing"` namespace
- Hero: title, subtitle, cta
- Features: feature1Title, feature1Desc, feature2Title, feature2Desc, feature3Title, feature3Desc
- Trust: metric1, metric2, metric3, metricLabel1, metricLabel2, metricLabel3
- Full Arabic translations for all strings
  </action>
  <verify>Run marketing app and verify all three sections render. Check Arabic layout (RTL) works correctly. Verify language switcher toggles between EN and AR. Check mobile responsiveness at 390px viewport.</verify>
  <done>Hero with CTA, Features grid, and Trust signals render in both EN and AR. Language switcher works. Layout is mobile-first and responsive.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Build Pricing section with Convex data and assemble full page</name>

    apps/marketing/src/components/sections/pricing.tsx

    apps/marketing/src/messages/en.json
    apps/marketing/src/messages/ar.json
  </files>
  <action>
**Pricing section (`pricing.tsx`):**
- "use client" component
- Uses `useQuery(api.systemConfig.getPlans)` to fetch pricing plans from Convex
- Renders pricing cards in a responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2-3 cols desktop, max 4 cards)
- Each card shows:
  - Plan name (use locale to pick `name` vs `nameAr`)
  - Price with currency (e.g., "1,500 EGP")
  - Duration (use locale to pick `duration` vs `durationAr`)
  - Feature bullet list (use locale to pick `features` vs `featuresAr`)
  - Optional badge ("Most Popular", "Best Value") with highlight styling
  - "Choose Plan" button — for now, just a placeholder onClick that logs. The checkout drawer integration comes in plan 05.
- Loading state: show skeleton cards while Convex query loads
- Empty state: if no plans configured, show a message "Plans coming soon"
- The highlighted plan (has badge) gets a slightly elevated card with primary border
- Accept a callback prop `onSelectPlan: (planId: string) => void` for future checkout integration

**Assemble full landing page (`page.tsx`):**
- Replace placeholder with full page assembly
- Order: Hero → Features → Pricing (id="pricing") → Trust Signals → Footer
- Add a simple footer with "2026 FitFast. All rights reserved." and locale-aware text
- Smooth scroll behavior for the Hero CTA → Pricing section link
- Add `scroll-smooth` to the page wrapper or html element

**Update messages:**
- Add pricing namespace strings: "choosePlan", "mostPopular", "bestValue", "month", "months", "perMonth", "plansComing"
- Arabic translations for all
  </action>
  <verify>Run marketing app. Verify pricing section renders (will show empty state if no plans configured in Convex). If you have Convex running, seed a test plan via `npx convex run systemConfig:updatePlans` and verify it appears. Check responsive layout at 390px and 1440px. Verify smooth scroll from Hero CTA to pricing section.</verify>
  <done>Full marketing landing page renders with Hero, Features, Pricing (from Convex), Trust Signals, and Footer. Pricing cards display dynamic data. Page works in both EN and AR with responsive layout.</done>
</task>

</tasks>
